## What
`Express` local server for testing application that communicates with `Firebase` via REST.
Inspired by [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), it uses [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb), *a small local JSON database powered by Lodash*.  Since `Firebase` uses a specific data structure, `json-server` itself wasn't helpful, so I needed a custom solution.

## How
##### run server
`nodemon index.js`
